# Introduction

WXT is a free and open source framework for building web extensions in an conventional, intuitive, and safe way **_for all browsers_**.

WXT is based of [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com), and aims to provide the same great DX with TypeScript, auto-imports, and an opinionated project structure.

## Conventions

WXT is an opinionated framework. This helps keep projects consistent and easy to pick up.

- **Generated manifest**: Based on your project's file structure
- **Entrypoint configuration**: Configure entrypoints from the same file they're declare in
- **Type-safety is a priority**: Out-of-the-box TypeScript support with improved browser API typing
- **Simple output file structure**: Output file paths minimize the path at runtime

## Development

WXT's dev server supports modern features like HMR to provide a lighting fast dev mode.

When changes can't be hot-reloaded, like content scripts or background scripts, they're reloaded individually to prevent reloading the entire extension and slowing down your development cycle.

## Production-ready

Production builds are optimized for store review, changing as few files as possible between builds.

In addition, WXT fully supports Firefox's source code requirements when using a bundler. It will automatically create and upload a ZIP file of your source code.

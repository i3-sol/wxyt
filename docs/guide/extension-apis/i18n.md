# Internationalization

This guide is for using the vanilla, `browser.i18n` APIs. There are two other alternatives:

1. [`@wxt-dev/i18n`](/guide/i18n/installation) - a wrapper around `browser.i18n` APIs with additional features, a simplified localization file format, and editor support
2. Third party packages - You can use any i18n package on NPM, most of which are more feature rich than `browser.i18n` and `@wxt-dev/i18n`

:::info
Currently, using the `browser.i18n` APIs are the recommended approach. WXT has some built-in support for them and they work well enough. `@wxt-dev/i18n` was recently released, and it will become the recommended approach after some of the bugs have been worked out. Head over to [it's docs](/guide/i18n/introduction.md) to learn more.

## Setup

First familiarize yourself with [Chrome's docs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/i18n). The only difference when using these APIs with WXT is where you put the localization files - in the [`public` directory](/guide/directory-structure/public/).

```
<srcDir>/
└─ public/
   └─ _locales/
      ├─ en/
      │  └─ messages.json
      ├─ de/
      │  └─ messages.json
      └─ ko/
         └─ messages.json
```

Next, to set a `default_locale` on your manifest, add it to your `wxt.config.ts` file:

```ts
// wxt.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  manifest: {
    default_locale: 'en',
    name: '__MSG_extName__',
    description: '__MSG_extDescription__',
  },
});
```

> You can localize the `name` and `description` of your extension from the `manifest` config as well.

Finally, to get a translation, call `browser.i18n.getMessage`:

```ts
browser.i18n.getMessage('extName');
browser.i18n.getMessage('extDescription');
browser.i18n.getMessage(/* etc */);
```

# Unlisted Scripts

TypeScript files that are built, but are not included in the manifest.

## Filenames

- `entrypoints/<name>.tsx?`
- `entrypoints/<name>/index.tsx?`

## Definition

Unlike the background and content scripts, you can define this script's logic in the main scope.

```ts
// Code goes here
```
